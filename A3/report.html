			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					Here is a population pyramid, often used to assess the age/gender breadown of different societies through time. Although sex and gender are not a binary, the census
					data is reported as such, so we wil proceed with this binarized perspective. On the left half of the figure, the age distribution for males in the 1900 and 2000 census are depicted, whereas
					the right half depicts the age distribution of females. Additionally, lines depicting the average age of each sex for both centures is included in the figure. We see clerarly here that there are more people in the year 2000 relative to 1900, and that these people (both male and female) are living
					longer lives. This is evident in the higher modes and skewing of the 2000 census to older ages. Particularly, females in the year 2000 are living much longer.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>To explore how there are more people in the year 2000 are that they are living longer, it's nice to compare directly to the 1900 data with bar plots. Thus, the population pyramid kills two birds with one stone by highlighting the 
					increase in the overall population and the shifting of the 2000 population to older ages. The added lines showing average age also quickly brings this to the reader's attention.
				</li>
				<li>This type of figure is the most expressive (i.e. highlighting all the dimensions of the underlying dataset). We're highlighting the total numbers of people in addition to the age/sex population breakdowns. While this is expressive, it makes it harder to draw conclusions on subtle things happening within the data. (see the next point.) </li>
				<li>By having bars for each age bin (every 5 years), we might be able to see subtle and interesting things occuring in the data. However, with this sketch, it's difficult to catch subtle differences in male vs. female populations since they are on
					separate plots (yet sharing the same axes and axes spans). In future sketches, I will try to more directly commpare female vs male within a century instead of solely focusing on 1900 vs 2000 overall population differences. 
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="sketch2.png" alt="Sorry I didn't have time to add. I can add later upon request." width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					Here is a CDF (cumulative distribution function) of age for the US population of females and males in the year 1900 and 2000. The y-axis is inverted so that the CDF goes down instead of up. Although sex and gender are not a binary, the census
					data is reported as such, so we wil proceed with this binarized perspective. Here we see again that females and males are living shorter lives in the year 1900 relative to the year 2000; however, now it is more clear that females in the year 2000 are 
					outliving all other data categories (female/male in 1900 and male in 2000). We can also begin to see a subtle decrease in the female cumulative age distribution relative to males in the year 19000. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>By transforming the data to represent the CDF of age for both sexes and centuries (i.e. all four catgorical groups of data), we can directly compare their overall distributions to each other on the same subplot (instead of having 2+ subplots to represent all 4 PDFs (probability distribution functions)). This makes comparisions between the four groups very easy and fast for the reader (compared to the first sketch which had more dimensions for the reader to first parse and then interpret.).  </li>
				<li>By dropping full expressiveness of the figure (i.e. not accounting for the total numbers of people but rather their normalized cumulative distributions), we can begin to parse more subtle information in the data, particularly the age distributions between the sexes. In particular, I am starting to appreciate subtle differences in the number of males and females around the ages of 20-45 in the year 1900. The subtle differences (mentioned above) are still way too subtle to draw any conclusions. So although I'm on the right track with this sketch (relative to the first sketch),  I will drop additional dimensions of the original dataset to further explore in the last sketch. </li>
				<li>Because the differences here are still subtle, I found it very hard to plot the lines in this figure without overlapping them. Since I use dashes vs lines and highlighter vs not as my visual encodings (i.e. markers) to distingush groups, it actually becomes hard to tell which lines possess which markers. So for my next sketch, I will transform the data in such a way to make the group markings simpler and easier to differentiate. </li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="sketch3.png" alt="Sorry I didn't have time to add. I can add later upon request." width="100%" height="auto"/>
				<figcaption>
					Here is the fraction of the US female population across all ages for the years 1900 and 2000. Although sex and gender are not a binary, the census data is reported as such, so we wil proceed with this binarized perspective. 
					The shaded box depicts a standard deviation from the 1:1 female:male population ratio, which we would expect if the birth/death rates are roughly equal for both sexes. Here we see that from the ages of 0 to 20, males and females in both centuries exist in near equal ratios (or at least within 1 standard deviation).
					However, between the ages of 20-50, there seems to be a drop in the female:male ratio to below a standard deviation (this is just sketched and roughly calculated and will be followed up on in the actual figure later). Interestingly enough this is around child-bearing ages, and I will further explore this later. In the year 2000, females 
					dominate over males after the age of 65, whereas we see this only for females above 80 in the year 1900. Thus, I think there are two interesting things occuring about sex-specific mortality: (1) something is happening in the year 1900 for females around 20-35	that is not happening in the year 2000, and (2) female mortality is lower than male mortality above the age of 65, particularly in the year 2000.			</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>By not being fully expressive of the underlying dimensionality of the data (i.e. ignoring the total population differneces and transforming the data into a ratio to directly compare female vs male in the two centuries), we can now really begin to see subtle age distribution differences. By plotting the box that shows (roughly) a standard deviation from the 1:1 female:male ratio, we can start to point out abnormalities as detailed in the figure caption. </li>
				<li>In addition to making the subtle differences more apparent, we have drastically reduced the different types of visual encodings in this figure, which makes it much more easy/fast to interpret than the proceeding figures. </li>
				<li>There is a bit of empty space in the top left corner of the plot now (since we only see the interesting aberations occuring after age ~20), so we have this space which we can use for plot insets to further explore the data in one figure. </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        When I started this assignment, I was sure I'd just stick with the population pyramid and that would be the best figure since it is the most expressive of the underlying dimensionality in the dataset. However, by transforming the data in the subsquent sketches, I was able to see more subtle interesting things in the data that was not at all apparent in the first sketch of the population pyramid. 
		The second sketch, which was an attempt to transform the data to show only the interesting information (i.e. here neglecting the obvious fact that there are more people in the year 2000 than 1900), was still too busy. There are now four different groups to plot on one plot that are sometimes only subtlely different. Thus the visual encodings I used to distinguish the different groups are barely useful since the CDFs of the different sexes still nearly overlap for the same century. 
		Thus, this process led me to conclude that if there is a lot of similarity (i.e. redundancy), then great! I can transform the data once again by simply finding the ratio (or fraction) of one sex within the total population. This was my last sketch, in which I could finally parse out interesting subtle information within the data. Here I was able to see sex-specific age distribution differences in the years 1900 and 2000. But now that this plot is much simpler (i.e. not as expressive but still showing the
		interesting aspects of the data), I don't have too many visual encodings to distinguish between groups and even have more white space in the figure to add more context/analysis to explain sex-specific age differenes (particularly to explore why females aged 20-45 in 1900 are much less common than their male counterparts).

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

				<figcaption>
					Percentage of the US female population across all ages for the years 1900 and 2000. Although sex and gender are not a binary, the census data is reported as such, so we wil proceed with this binarized perspective. 
					The shaded box depicts 1 standard deviation (2.7%) above and below the 1:1 female:male ratio, which we would expect if the birth/death rates are roughly equal for both sexes. Here we see that from the ages of 0 to 20, males and females in both centuries exist in near equal ratios (within 1 standard deviation).
					However, after age 20, there are two major deviations in the female:male ratio. (a) Between the ages of 35-50, there is a drop in the female:male ratio to below a standard deviation. Since child-bearing ages directly proceed this drop, I wanted to understand if this phenomenon could be attributable to maternal mortality. 
					The  <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=ada6d5376ee95e3aJmltdHM9MTcwOTI1MTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0yYjc1YTAzNi0zODk1LTY1Y2ItMmYzNi1iNDM2Mzk2ODY0MDYmaW5zaWQ9NTQ5OQ&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=2b75a036-3895-65cb-2f36-b43639686406&psq=maternal+mortality+year+1900+850&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWpvZy5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS9TMDAwMi05Mzc4KDExKTAwOTYyLTgvZnVsbHRleHQjOn46dGV4dD1JbiUyMDE5MDAlMkMlMjB0aGUlMjBtYXRlcm5hbCUyMG1vcnRhbGl0eSUyMHJhdGUlMjBpbiUyMHRoZSxjaGlsZGJpcnRoJTJDJTIwd2hpY2glMjBpcyUyMGFsbW9zdCUyMGElMjA5OSUyNSUyMHJlZHVjdGlvbi4lMjA0&ntb=1">
						American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology</a> reports that the 1900 maternal mortality rate was 850 per 100,000 births. Thus, we could estimate the number of births per year by counting the total number of females and males in the "0" age bin (which accounts for children aged 0-4) and dividing by 5 (assuming roughly equal birth rates across the preceeding 5 years). Mulitplying the maternal mortality per birth by the approximated number of births thus yields the number of deaths attributable to maternal mortality.
						Since the female:male ratio is roughly equal for the first 20 or so years, we can see if maternal mortality accounts for this deviation seen in ages 35-50. In the inset plot, I show the raw counts of females and males aged 10 to 45 in the year 1900. Assuming that women start bearing children in the 1900s after the age of 15, we can test if subtracting the male population by the integrated maternal deaths accounts for the female age distribution (red dashdot line). As can be seen, this approximation can explain the female population 
						strinkingly well in the red shaded region (between ages 15-35); after which, the approximation underestimates the actual female population. This thus suggests that maternal mortality is potentially the major cause in the deviation from the 1:1 female:male ratio and occurred during the child-bearing ages of 15-35 but persisted until age 50 due to the integrated loss of maternal lives over that 20 year span. (b) Additionally, we see that females dominate the population in aged populations. For females in the year 2000, 
						we see this dominance in population over the age of 65. In the year 1900, this is seen for females above 80---probably delayed due to the earlier loss of life attributable to maternal mortality. Seemingly, males across the centuries appear to have higher aged mortality rates compared to females. However, this only becomes evident in the year 2000 likely due to (a) decreased maternal mortality and (b) better healthcare for aging people, particularly women.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        My final design was heavily influenced by the process of making sketches earlier. As mentioned before, I iteratively made each sketch less expressive (i.e. transforming the data from its original dimensionality to only report what I deemed interesting and to reduce the amount of visual encodings required to report the data)
		and more focused on age/mortality differences between the sexes aross the centuries. I appreciated that the sketches became more granular because of interesting observations I made in prior sketches. In this way, making the sketches helped me narrow down which quesiton I wanted to ask, i.e. "How have 100 years of medical advancements affected the US population?".
		By choosing to focus on the transformed data of female:male ratios, I can then focus the analysis and visualizaiton on deviations from 1:1 female:male ratios. If birth/immigration/emigration rates for males and females have not been substanitally decreasing over the last 200 years, then the only major negative flux in aging is attributable to death rates. By explictly shading in the region that falls within 1 standard deviation of the 1:1 female:male ratio, it then becomes
		immediately apparent when there is a deviation.
      </p>
	  <p>
		The visualization then revealed 2 major deviations, seemingly attributable to: (a) maternal mortality and (b) increased mortality rates in aging males. By annotating the figure with "(a)" and "(b)" to highlight these two deviations, I think the visualization
		more directly addresses the main question: "How have 100 years of medical advancements affected the US population?". Seemingly, females have substantially benefited from healthcare and technology advances over the last 100 years---ironically despite much of modern healthcare and technology being designed around male users. Evidently, simply reducing maternal mortality (with better hygeine and simple medications) went a long way in improving female health outcomes over the last century.
        I think the addition of the inset plot where I tested the hypothesis that maternal mortality was the main driver in the deviation from the 1:1 female:male ratio directly answers the question "How have 100 years of medical advancements affected the US population?". It clearly points to maternal mortality being the main driver in the deviation of the female:male ratio seen in (a). I was confused how much annotation I should add to the figure to explain this analysis and whether I should have reported a data source directly in the figure for the 
		maternal mortality rate in 1900. I'd love to hear feedback/suggestions. Regardless, by transforming the data to highlight the most interesting/relevant information, reducing the number of different visual encodings, and having simple legends/titles/etc. gave me more room in the figure to add the inset plot wihtout making it too busy. I could never have done this type of additional analysis if I kept with one of my first two sketches.
	  </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		Overall, I found the process of making sketches very uesful to narrow down which questions I want to ask by iteratively transforming the data to follow interesting trends. This however brings up one major bias: what is intersesting/relevant in the data? Obviously it depends on the questions being asked, 
		and who is asking the question. But similar to how I parsed/transformed/simplified the data to follow "interesting" trends in the data, I'm sure my peers probably found many other "interesting" trends that then led them to different data transformations, visual encoding schemes, and visaulizations. I'd be interested to see how different everyone's questions, analyses, and visualizations turned out. One additional thing that surprised me in this assignment was that having the most expressive figure is not always the best. I could only really see the "interesting"
		trends after parsing/transforming the data. In some intuitve sense I must have already known this, but it was still kind of funny to see how this excerse really demonstrated this point to me. In relation to my main figure, it was pretty striking how much maternal mortality seemed to account for the deviation seen in the female:male ratio. This perspective was not at all apparent until I was able to perform the additional analysis in the inset plot---and I only had the space/idea to do the additional analysis after simplifying the main plot from my previous sketches.
